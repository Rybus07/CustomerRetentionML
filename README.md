# CustomerRetentionML

### Background:
In many industries, retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Businesses often face challenges in predicting which customers are likely to churn (stop using their services or products). By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, companies can implement strategies to improve customer retention.

### Objective:
Develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning. The model should analyze historical customer data to determine which features (such as usage patterns, customer demographics, transaction history, etc.) are most indicative of churn.

## Specific Goals:

### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

- Gather a dataset that contains customer information, transaction history, and churn labels (1 for churned, 0 for retained).
- Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Dataset

This project uses the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Perform EDA to identify trends and patterns in the data.
- Visualize the relationship between various features and churn rates using plots and graphs.

### Feature Engineering:

- Create new features that may improve the predictive power of your model. For example, calculate the frequency of transactions, average transaction value, or customer engagement scores.

### Model Building:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train multiple classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or XGBoost) and compare their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

### Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the models using confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess their performance.
- Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

### Insights and Recommendations:

- Analyze the features that contribute most to churn.
- Provide actionable recommendations for customer retention strategies based on your findings.
